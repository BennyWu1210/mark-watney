<b>Elon Musk</b>, the CEO and founder of the world’s 2 largest company in terms of market cap - SpaceX and Tesla - has stir up controversy recently by claiming a potential personal involvement in the rescue of the astronaut Mark Watney. Now this seems to be more possible than ever before. 

Whether it is moral to involve a private company in a global manner and if Elon’s sole intention is to gain international publicity - these are the real concerns of the public. From the Trillionaire’s interview last Saturday with the Fox News Channel, he denied to reveal how specifically he could support the matter. However, according to an anonymous source who has leaked crucial information with a SMW reporter this morning, it seems like Elon Musk is planning to contribute 1/3 of his wealth (approximately $1.2 Trillion of cash) as well as 2 of SpaceX’s newly designed rockets armed with the world’s most advanced Ion engines. The news have shocked the world.

Many know that the 65-year-old Elon has been a diehard Mars-colonization supporter since the early 2000s. If the rumours turns out to be true, experts say that he could significantly speed up the process of Mark’s rescue, including NASA’s projects such as Iris. 

However, some are also worried about the consequences of his actions. “By doing so, Mr. Musk could monopolize the space exploration field,” says Professor Shawn Yuen in an interview, “there will be severe consequences, I’m afraid that the world is going out of hand only for one person’s life”.
