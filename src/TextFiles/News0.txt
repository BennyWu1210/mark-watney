The Mission…🚀,

It is the year 2035. After almost a century of crazy development, the world has seen unprecedented growth in the field of space exploration. “Ares 4” was one of the many crazy missions that shocked the world and truly demonstrates our potential, many believe that it is human’s first step of conquering the Solar System. 

The 6 astronauts landed on Mars 324 Sols (a solar day on Mars) ago. Everything was going great until a giant dust storm approaches their base on Sol 6, the astronauts were forced to leave. The problem is: only 5 of them were able to come back

It turned out that the 6th astronaut was alive, miraculously. Up until today, it has been 318 Sols, 13 hours and 18 minutes since the unlucky astronaut - Mark Watney - was stranded on a red planet 180 million kilometers away from our home. The space agency and countless scientists around the world are on a mission to rescue him.

Mark is a true pioneer of humanity. Many say that the World has never been this united before, and that is exactly what the “Save Mark Watney” organization is aiming for - spread hope while bringing humanity together against this challenge.
