The reactions of the crew members prove that one must never lose their hope; instead, they should be diligent, while believing that they will succeed in the end. The author clearly proves that it is such belief and determination that will lead to one’s success.
Another important theme/lesson of “The Martian” is that one should never lose their curiosity - it is such wonder that truly leads to motivation and eventually innovation. This is not only shown on the crewmates but also on Mark Watney himself. In the story, Mark is never afraid of exploring different solutions to save his life, even if it might put his life at risk. While exploring on Mars, his fearlessness and optimism is shown as clear as it can be through his own words: 
<i>“It’s a strange feeling. Everywhere I go, I’m the first. Step outside the rover? First guy ever to be there! Climb a hill? First guy to climb that hill! Kick a rock? That rock hadn’t moved in a million years!” (Weir 99)</i>
<i>“I’m the first guy to drive long-distance on Mars. The first guy to spend more than thirty-one sols on Mars. The first guy to grow crops on Mars. First, first, first!” (Weir 99)</i>

Evidently, his fearlessness paid off at the end since he is able to keep him alive until the rescue comes. Despite being an extremely challenging process, he never gave up. While proving this important theme of never losing one’s curiosity, Andy Weir simultaneously encourages the readers to be fearless and innovative in tough situations; and only by doing so will they achieve success.
