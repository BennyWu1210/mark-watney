As the mission to rescue Mark Watney continues, the world seems to be more united than ever before. All geopolitical conflicts are also nowhere to be seen. This phenomenon is shown, quite ironically, as the largest rivals in the current world - China and the U.S - turn out to work together peacefully in the story to resolve a common struggle. Undoubtedly, Andy Weir is able to prove within his utopian world that humans could stand together under a common struggle: deep in their hearts, they are sympathetic toward each other.  

The story also proves that determination is the key to success. This mentality applies to the director of NASA, Teddy Sanders, himself, as it is observed that he “pondered the faint, red dot among the stars” while saying “hang in there, Watney…we’re coming” (Weir 131). Clearly, the determination of the whole planet, from top to bottom, eventually led to a successful rescue.

Last but not least, an interesting theory term that can be observed in the story is “gender stereotypes”, as the characters in the story who hold power are mainly males, including the president of the U.S, the director of NASA, as well as most other directors/scientists of the rescue mission. The gender imbalance is a reason why I’ve created the character “Chairman Babcock”, it ironically criticizes the male-domniated society in “The Martian” while proving what the story could not demonstrate: females are just as capable as dealing with power as males.
