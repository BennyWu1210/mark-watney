Below is a portion of the interview with the Ares 3 Crew (<i>Commander Melissa Lewis, Major Rick Martinez, Alex Vogel, Doctor Chris Beck, Beth Johanssen</i>). Three months ago, they chose to return to Mars while risking their lives to save their good friend, Mark Watney, who they’ve accidentally left behind. They are currently on their way back to Mars.
<b>Reporter:</b> 

Nice to meet you all up there! First off, I want to say thank you for your service on behalf of everyone on Earth, you are all seen as true heroes. 

<b>Commander Lewis:</b>

Thank you, it is our pleasure to be here with you

<b>Reporter:</b> 

Many reports suggest that the chances of successfully rescuing Mark Watney is around 30-50%, and the trip potentially puts all of you in danger. Knowing the risk involved, what made y’all decide to return to Mars?

<b>Commander Lewis:</b>

As the commander, I personally have a large responsibility for the incident… Our crew has already had many discussions before making this difficult decision. At the end, we have reached a consensus that saving our friend is the correct choice, regardless of what the so-called percentage of survival. For now, the only thing we can do is to be hopeful.

<b>Major Rick Martinez:</b>

For sure, being hopeful is the key. However, I should correct you there, Commander Lewis. It is not you, or anybody’s fault that Mark is left behind. At this point, It’s just, as humans and as good friends of Mark, we can’t bear to watch him starve to death.
