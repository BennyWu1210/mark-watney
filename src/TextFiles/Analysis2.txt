The increase in prices of potatoes shown in this news article demonstrates a theory term - conspicuous consumption. Despite the fact that the situation shows the world being very united and people rooting for Mark Watney, it still illustrates the widespread capital ideology of valuing objects by its sign value, rather than its actual use value. 

This mentality is very common in the fictional world shown in this website. People who are raising the prices of potatoes - such as the fictional character “collector Stanley Se” - buy potatoes which have close to no value prior to the Ares 3 mission. Comically, it shows the severity of conspicuous consumption as “a $21 million potato” is auctioned to someone who only has a “net worth [of] $22 million”. These actions are juxtaposed by the main character Mark Watney who is on Mars meanwhile, utilizing everything to its fullest use value in order to increase his chance of survival.
