The prices of potatoes have risen by 734% in the past year. According to farmers, importers and manufactures, this value will continue to rise in the coming months due to a violent increase in global demand. There is no question that potatoes have now become a luxury item.

How did we even reach to this point? Well, this dates back to almost a year ago, a time where Mark Watney struggles to continue with his food source as rescue won’t be able to come in his way for a long period of time. As an experienced botanist himself, he attempts plants the few remaining potatoes he has in Mars soil. Miraculously, he succeeded. He did something that NASA once thought it was not possible, and Mark became the first ever human to plant in another planet’s soil. 

Since then, potatoes have been seen as a symbol of hope and peace. You can now see them in museums and billionaire’s showcase. Last week, a $21 million potato was auctioned to a collector, Stanley Se, who lives in the region of Canada. (According to sources, his net worth is $22 million dollar).
