Elon’s Musk’s act presented in this news article demonstrates the sympathetic nature of humans, as it clearly shows how he is willing to sacrifice a part of his wealth for the greater good. Similar to the Ares 3 crew, NASA scientists, as well as the public in the science fiction “The Martian”, Elon in this fictional world is willing to do whatever possible in order to save Mark Watney, despite an extremely low success rate.
Additionally, the great dedication in the rescue is also clearly presented in the story. When the world realizes that Mark is still alive, Venkat Kapoor, the director of the Mars Mission, steps out and encourages the public: “I can’t promise we’ll succeed in rescuing him, but I can promise this: The entire focus of NASA will be to bring Mark Watney home. This will be our overriding and singular obsession until he is either back on Earth or confirmed dead on Mars” (Weir 62). Evidently, there is no doubt that humans can be extremely united and dedicated, driven by their sympathetic nature. The author Andy Weir does not hesitate to prove this.
